## Project 1: Tide calculator
* Marine and river works need to be planned considering tide heights.
* Reading manually from tide tables booklets is not practical for extended analysis periods.
* This tool allows to quikly estimate intervals when tide heights are below a set limit, between two given dates, and a given working schedule.
* This tool was specially useful for planning long marine works at the London Tideway Project.
* River Thames tide tables are publicly available for download from the PLA.<br /><br />

## Project 2: Booking cancellation case study
* A significant number of hotel bookings are called off because of cancellations and no-shows.
* Revenue losses can be high when free cancellation options or low cost penalties apply, particularly on last-minute cancellations. 
* A dataset containing information of hotel bookings is used to build ML models to predict cancellations.
* A logistic regression and a decision tree help to find the factors affecting bookings cancellations.
* Cross validation and grid search were performed for both ML models.<br /><br />

## Project 3: Optimization
*  Products X and Y to be produced through two assembly lines sharing one packaging line.
*  Production volumes on each assembly line are bounded by minimum demands and maximum capacities.
*  Total output constrained by the capacity of the shared packaging line.
*  Total profit objective function to be maximised. <br /><br />

## Project 4: Weather patterns
*  Data was sourced from The National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI).
*  Daily maximum and minimum (high-low) temperatures from 24 weather stations near Ann Arbor (Michigan, United States) was analyzed.
*  Periods of extraordinary weather conditions reveal on a scatter plot, showing temperatures registered in 2015 breaking the previous 10-year high-low records (2005-2014).<br /><br />
