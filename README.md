## [Project 1: Tide predictor](https://github.com/FranciscoGabrielMiranda/Tide_predictions)
* Marine and river works need to be planned considering tide heights.
* Referring to traditional tide tables booklets is time consuming for long periods.
* This tool allows to quikly estimate intervals when tide heights are below a set limit, between two given dates and working schedule.
* This tool was specially useful for planning long marine works at the London Tideway Project.
* River Thames tide tables are publicly available for download from the PLA.

## [Project 2: Booking cancellation case study](https://github.com/FranciscoGabrielMiranda/Hotel_bookings_cancellations)
* A significant number of hotel bookings are called off because of cancellations and no-shows.
* Revenue losses can be high when free cancellation options or low cost penalties apply, particularly on last-minute cancellations. 
* A dataset containing information of hotel bookings is used to build ML models to predict cancellations.
* A logistic regression and a decision tree help to find the factors affecting bookings cancellations.

## [Project 3: Weather patterns](https://github.com/FranciscoGabrielMiranda/Weather_patterns)
* Weather patterns over long periods can be clearly appreciated on plots and graphs.
* A dataset contains daily maximum and minimum (high-low) temperatures corresponding to 24 weather stations near Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States.
* A plot showing temperatures registered in 2015 breaking the previous ten year high-low records (2005-2014).
* The dataset comes from The National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI).
